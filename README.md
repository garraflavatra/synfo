# Synfo

A program with which you can retrieve several types of system info (about
hardware, software etc.).

## Installation

```shell
npm install synfo --global
```

## Usage

I don't think I could have made it easier:

```shell
synfo <info_name>
```

Where `<info_name>` is one of:

- hardware
- hostname
- kernelrelease
- kernelversion
- sysname
- uname
